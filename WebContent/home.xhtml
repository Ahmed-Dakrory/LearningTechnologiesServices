      This is an example of a simple Facelets template. Here, header, footer and
      side menu bar appear from the template file (<i>content.xhtml</i>). This
      section (rendering here--what you're reading) appears from the
      template client (<i>home.xhtml</i>).
      </p>

      <p>
      All (header, footer and content) are united in the template file,
      <i>content.xhtml</i>, which is summarily included by this file
      (<i>home.html</i>).
      </p>

      <h4> How this works... </h4>

      <p>
      The files <i>header.xhtml</i> and <i>footer.xhtml</i> are NOT anything to
      do with templating, but with mere inclusion. The template file happens to
      include them.
      </p>

      <p>
      <i>content.xhtml</i>, the template file, acts with this file
      (<i>home.xhtml</i>), also formally known as the template client or
      "consumer," to accomplish the templating in our example.
      </p>

      <p>
      Think of a single page (this example). The template file is the one that
      makes use of while the template client
      makes use of . <i>home.xhtml</i> and not
      <i>content.xhml</i> is what is "visible" to the browser user (i.e.: is
      on the URI) who does not request the template file (<i>content.xhml</i>),
      <i>header.xhtml</i>, or <i>footer.xhtml</i>, but only this file
      (<i>home.xhtml</i>). That's why all except this file are subsumed under
      the template subdirectory.
